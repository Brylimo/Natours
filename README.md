    Sass source code ->(Sass compiler)-> Compiled CSS code
    
    Main Sass features
    * Variables: for reusable values such as colors, font-sizes, spacing, etc.
    * Nesting: to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code.
    * Operators: for mathematical operations right inside of CSS.
    * Partials and imports: to write CSS in different files and importing them all into one single file.
    * Mixins: to wirte reusable pieces off CSS code.
    * Functions: similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can be used.
    * Extends: to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them.
    * Control directives: for writing complex code using conditionals and loops.
